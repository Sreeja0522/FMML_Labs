# Welcome to My GitHub Repository for AI/ML Training Program

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This space contains all the projects, practice codes, and learning materials from the **24-Week AI/ML Training Program from IIITH** I attended. This program was an incredible journey where I had the privilege to learn from **Dr. CK Raju, PhD** from I-hub data IIIT Hyderabad, and gain hands-on experience in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
This course provided me with an exceptional opportunity to gain research-based project experience, guided by expert faculty from the prestigious International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad (IIIT-H). The coursework was carefully designed to blend theoretical knowledge with practical applications, enabling me to build a strong foundation in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

Through this program, I worked on real-world projects that honed my problem-solving and analytical skills. I explored modern tools and frameworks such as TensorFlow and scikit-learn, and applied cutting-edge techniques in supervised and unsupervised learning. Collaborating on assignments helped me understand team dynamics in research and development.

Additionally, the program emphasized performance evaluation and metrics, providing a clear understanding of how to measure model effectiveness. This aspect was particularly helpful in fine-tuning solutions for complex datasets.

By engaging with projects on clustering, regression, and neural networks, I gained firsthand experience in implementing algorithms and understanding their nuances. The facultyâ€™s guidance was instrumental in clarifying doubts and encouraging a deeper exploration of concepts.

Overall, this course has equipped me with the skills and confidence to tackle advanced AI/ML problems and embark on further research or industry roles.This course provided me with an exceptional opportunity to gain research-based project experience, guided by expert faculty from the prestigious International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad (IIIT-H).
